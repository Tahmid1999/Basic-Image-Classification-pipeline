# Basic-Image-Classification-pipeline
1. Use the CIFARâ€™s dataloader 
2. Read training images and labels in the numpy arrays.
3. Train them using Nearest Neighborhood Classifier.
4. Read the Test images and predict the test images with your nearest neighborhood classifier.
5. Calculate the confusion matrix, accuracy, and F1 score
6. Modify code for kNN classifier. Change K =3, and compare the performance
